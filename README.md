As a software engineer with over 15 years of experience in developing solutions for Fortune 500s, start-ups and small businesses, I am confident that I can meet the highest standards of quality for remote projects. I understand coding practices and can quickly familiarize myself with technical issues and business objectives, enabling me to deliver timely results to a very high standard.
I was able to make a unique contribution to the software engineering field when I developed Baucis â€“ a tool that allows for the creation of scalable REST APIs, with a notable decrease in development cost and time investment. Baucis v1.0 was launched to great success, receiving 96,000 downloads in the first 30 days of release in 2015. Since then, the tool has been adopted by a number of commercial projects and discussed in various articles and presentations across the world.
I have a passion for engaging and meaningful projects that test my innovative skill set and offer the challenge of creating effective solutions. If you are looking for a capable senior software engineering professional to lend their expertise to projects that will have a lasting impact on your organization, I welcome the opportunity to discuss my ideas and approach.
